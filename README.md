# Following the Postgres Tutorial and Docs
Postgres seems to be what everyone is using with Python these days, so to brush up on SQL in general, I'm going to start with the official tutorial and then go through some of the documentation. I will work and post the examples on a Windows 10 system.

* [PostgreSQL Tutorial (sections 1-3)](postgres1-3.md)
* [PostgreSQL Documentation 4 (SQL Syntax) and 5 (Data Definition)](postgres4-5.md)
* [PostgreSQL Documentation 6 (Data Manipulation) and 7 (Queries)](postgres6-7.md)
